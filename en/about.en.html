                <p>
                  Hi, I'm <strong>Michaela Valik</strong>! I'm a nutritionist, a
                  certified Nutrition Coach, and most importantly, a mum. I was
                  born in the Czech Republic, and today I live on the beautiful
                  Gold Coast with my husband and our four-year-old daughter.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I’m currently completing the final year of my Bachelor of Food
                  and Nutrition at La Trobe University in Australia, where I
                  focus on nutrition, science, physiology, and eating behaviour.
                  I have also completed the Nutrition Masterclass with Markéta
                  Gajdošová, which gave me a deeper understanding of mindset and
                  client work. I’m constantly learning — and everything I learn,
                  I bring directly into my coaching.

                <p>
                  Life as a mum showed me how challenging it can be to balance
                  work, family, health, and everything in between. It also
                  taught me that healthy eating doesn’t need to be complicated.
                  Simple habits, practical meals, and a little consistency can
                  change everything — and that’s exactly what I help my clients
                  build.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For me, health isn’t just about what we eat. It’s about
                  feeling good in your body, enjoying food without guilt, and
                  building habits that fit your life — not work against it.
                  Whether it’s a morning walk on the beach, cooking easy meals
                  for my family, or taking a few minutes just for myself… I
                  truly believe it’s the little things that make the biggest
                  difference.
                </p>

                <p>
                  My approach is personal, realistic, and supportive. I’ll help
                  you feel better, have more energy, lose weight without
                  dieting, and find balance that lasts. Because every woman is
                  different — and your journey should be just as unique as you
                  are.
